Adaptive Antenna Scheduling to minimize chip temperature in mm Wave mobile Devices

Tags: mmWave, Mobile, antenna chip temperature, antenna scheduling

Issue: Our investigation shows that due to high throughput and small chip size, millimeter wave communication modules reach excessively high temperature in prolonged usage.   

Objective: We aim to minimize the maximum temperature reached by the antenna chips of a millimeter wave mobile communication module.

System Model: We assume a standard hand-held mobile communication module, transmitting and receiving on the 60GHz radio channel, one of the millimeter wave channels that are being pitched for next generation Wireless Networking for multi-gigabits throughput. We assume four sets of millimeter wave antenna arrays equip the mobile device- a convenient design to offer the option of scheduling between the arrays to keep the maximum temperature reached by any of the antenna arrays at tolerable levels. It can be assumed that switching transmission/reception between the arrays is instantaneous and consumes no additional power when the switching is done intermittently.
